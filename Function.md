This Python script is designed to create a web application using Streamlit that visualizes data related to water indicators for different districts or parties (in this case, "Moreno" and "Merlo"). The visualization includes:

An interactive map: Using Folium, the script generates a map centered around a specific location, with markers indicating each district. When you hover over a marker, it displays the value of the selected indicator for that district.
A line chart: Using Plotly, the script creates a line chart showing the trend of the selected indicator over time for the chosen districts.
Core Functionalities and Code Breakdown


Import Necessary Libraries:

-os: For interacting with the operating system, such as loading files.
-pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
-streamlit: For creating web applications.
-folium: For creating interactive maps.
-streamlit_folium: To integrate Folium maps into Streamlit.
-logging: For logging messages and debugging.
-datetime: For working with dates and times.
-plotly.express: For creating various types of plots.


Define Constants and Functions:

-COORDENADAS_PARTIDOS: A dictionary storing the geographical coordinates of the districts.
-obtener_numero_mes: A function to convert month names to numbers.
-crear_mapa: This function creates a Folium map, filters the data based on selected indicators and districts, and adds markers to the map.
-crear_grafico: This function creates a Plotly line chart, showing the trend of the selected indicator over time for the chosen districts.
-cargar_datos: This function loads data from an Excel file, cleans it, and prepares it for analysis.


Main Function:

-Load data: Reads data from an Excel file.
-Create user interface: Uses Streamlit to create a web interface with dropdowns for selecting districts, indicators, and time periods.
-Generate visualizations: When a user makes selections, the crear_mapa and crear_grafico functions are called to generate the corresponding visualizations.
-Display results: The generated map and chart are displayed in the Streamlit app.


Key Features and Techniques

-Data Cleaning and Preparation: The code handles missing values and converts data types appropriately.
-Interactive Visualization: Streamlit provides a user-friendly interface for exploring the data.
Map Creation: Folium is used to create a base map and add markers representing the districts.
-Time Series Analysis: Plotly is used to create a line chart showing the trend of the indicator over time.
-Flexibility: The code can be easily adapted to different datasets and visualization requirements.


Specific Code Breakdown

-Data Loading: The cargar_datos function reads data from an Excel file, handles potential errors, and cleans the data.
-Map Creation: The crear_mapa function filters the data based on user selections, calculates values for each district, and adds markers to the map with corresponding values.
-Chart Creation: The crear_grafico function creates a DataFrame with the necessary data for the chart, and then uses Plotly Express to generate a line chart.
